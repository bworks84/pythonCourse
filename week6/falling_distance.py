Assignment: Module 4 - Falling Distance
Purpose: Calculate falling distance based on gravity and time calculation, weight is constant


    ASSIGNMENT 1: Falling Distance

When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period:

d = 1/2 gt2

The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.

Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an objectâ€™s falling time (in seconds) as an argument. The function should return the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time interval. Write a program that demonstrates the function by prompting the user for the total time and calling the function in a loop that passes the time values in 5 second increments as the argument and displays the elapsed time and return value. The output should have a header identifying the column names and tabular formatted values (values displayed are to illustrate formatting only):

Time	Distance
0	0.0
5	30.0
10	45.0
15	52.0

g = 9.8

time_Seconds = int(input("Enter a time in seconds\n"))

# distance_traveled = 1/2 * gravity rate * (input time in seconds squared)


def fallingDistance(time_Seconds):
    distance_traveled = 0.5 * g * (time_Seconds ** 2)
    return distance_traveled


distance_traveled = int(time_Seconds / 2)

print("Secs\tDistance")
# used d to give better range of time/distance than just 5
for i in range(d):
    # calculates time in increments of 5 (seconds) -> 0 + 1 = 1 * 5
    time = (i + 1) * 5
    # formatting the print statement, rounding the calc of func by 2 places
    print(str(time) + "\t" + str(round(fallingDistance(time), 2)))
