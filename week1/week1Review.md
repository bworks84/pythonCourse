# Week 1 Review

#### (Reminder) - To see what you're viewing press cmd + k, then let go and press v

# Overview

1. Very basic review of Python objects this week. I wanted to simply review to get my mind back into coding and lay the groundwork for diving into some of them much more this coming week.
2. I also want to start integrating my code into cybersecurity projects, so refreshing my skills is import to grow in both areas

# Lessons learned this week

1. Functions, loops, modules, classes, and recursion.

- I think next week I will really focus on functions, loops, and classes. I want to get better with my ability to unpack data from different data structures using loops.
- I also want to focus writing cleaner code and understanding different code, which I will use ChatGPT to help explain when I can't read it on my own in simplistic way

# Going forward

1. I think I want to integrate a small project every week to build on the skills that I'm learning/reviewing throughout the week.
